3. To compile the program, run the following command: g++ dataProcessing.cpp -o dataProcessing
4. To run the program, run the appropriate command:
   - For Windows: dataProcessing.exe

5. Enter the following commands to perform your desired actions:

To improve this assignment, I think the instructions could be more organized with the specific requirements listed underneath each function. Instructions should be made clear on how the program should run. For example, should there be a static function which runs an example of the program, or should user input be considered to show its functionality.
